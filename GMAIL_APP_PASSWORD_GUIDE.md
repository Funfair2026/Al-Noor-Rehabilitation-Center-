# Gmail App Password Setup Guide

## Why You Need an App Password

Gmail doesn't allow regular passwords for SMTP anymore. You need to:
1. Enable 2-Step Verification
2. Create an App Password (16 characters)

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Enable 2-Step Verification

1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. Find "2-Step Verification" section
3. Click "Get started" or "Turn on"
4. Follow the steps to enable it
5. You'll need your phone to verify

### Step 2: Create App Password

1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   - If you don't see this link, make sure 2-Step Verification is enabled first
   
2. You'll see a page asking:
   - **Select app**: Choose "Mail"
   - **Select device**: Choose "Other (Custom name)"
   - **Name**: Enter "Funfair System" (or any name you want)
   
3. Click "Generate"

4. You'll see a 16-character password like: `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`
   - **IMPORTANT**: Copy this password (remove spaces if any)
   - This is what you'll use instead of your regular password
   - You can only see it once!

### Step 3: Use the App Password

Once you have the 16-character App Password, provide it to me and I'll:
- Set it up in the system
- Test email sending
- Start the server

## Important Notes

- Your regular Gmail password (`Alnoor2025`) won't work for SMTP
- You MUST use the 16-character App Password
- The App Password looks like: `abcd efgh ijkl mnop` (16 characters, sometimes with spaces)
- Remove spaces when using it: `abcdefghijklmnop`
